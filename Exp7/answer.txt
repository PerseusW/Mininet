How does TMUDP cause trouble?

1. It is implemented in the application layer.
    Software implementation requires more resources from CPU.

2. It has no required congestion control(although we could add it),
    which could lead to overflow of data in the network infrastructure,
    especially if the network is already congested(a loss-loss situation).

3. It doesn't have required mechanisms to fully utilize link bandwidth.
    This would waste bandwidth and time which are crucial resources.

4. Unlike TCP, we can only demultiplex by (destination IP, destination Port).
    If we want to achieve TCP-like demultiplex, then we have to implement it ourselves.
